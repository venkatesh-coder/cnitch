# Cnitch - clone of tsoding's [snitch](https://github.com/tsoding/snitch),but written in C.

Goals of this project:
    * Work with non git repos
    * Only recognise the filetype specific comments.
    * Group the TODO/FIXME by programming languages.

I may not implement the feature for creating issue in github.
